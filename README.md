# -PixelSense-Fashion-Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
PixelSense is a deep learning project focused on classifying grayscale fashion images into predefined apparel categories using neural networks. The project compares a baseline Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to highlight the importance of spatial feature learning in image classification tasks.
